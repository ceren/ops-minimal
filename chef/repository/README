# this is a minimalist chef-solo brew
# created as a simple example and starting point.

# most complexity has been removed, some libraries have been left for your convenience.
# these libraries are associated with recipes which were removed.
# feel free to ignore or remove these.
# trying to keep this as simple as possible of a starting point.

# dont expect any of the tests to pass, all though they may. can use as reference
# recipes using those libraries and tests available upon request.
